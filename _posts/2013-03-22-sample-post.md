**About the speakers**

**Dr. Seán Ó’Riordáin** is an independent consultant specialising in assisting both public and private clients confronting the many challenges of public policy development at local and national level in Ireland.

Sean previously was Head of the Local Government Unit at the Institute of Public Administration where he was responsible for all IPA training and development initiatives for the local government and local development systems in Ireland and representing Ireland on a number of European Commission Expert Committees.

He became the Managing Partner of Environmental Resources Management (ERM), the largest, independent, full service environmental consultancy in the world up until he commenced his Doctoral programme in the NUI, Maynooth in 2004. He is one of Irelands leading experts on local Government.

**David O’Connor** was appointed as County Manager of Fingal County Council in 2006 when he set out to build a communicating and connected organisation to better serve the rapidly growing population and economy of Fingal that forms a vital part of the Dublin City Region. He attributes the progress made to working closely with staff.

David is an architect who worked for nine years in private practice following qualification. He joined the local authority service in 1985 with Dublin Corporation where he worked in housing design and urban renewal, including managing the procurement of the 2nd phase of the Wood Quay offices.

He was appointed County Architect to the newly-formed Fingal County Council in 1995 and served eight years securing new headquarters in Swords to include housing and civic buildings for the authority. Having been appointed to Director of Planning in Fingal he served in this position for three years until he took up his current position.

**Andrew Montague**, is a former Lord Mayor of Dublin, a councillor on Dublin City Council and is the current chair of Dublin’s City Development Board. Andrew lives in Ballymun and is the Chair of Ballymun Drugs Task Force, Chair of the Social Regeneration Committee of Ballymun Regeneration and a Director of the Ballymun Whitehall Area Partnership.

Andrew is a strong advocate of a directly elected mayor for Dublin, making the case that a mayor has the potential to encourage significant inward investment in the city and can lead a tourism drive.

Andrew is the councillor that first proposed the Dublinbikes scheme, one of the most successful City Bike schemes in the world and Andrew chairs Dublin City Council’s Transport Committee.
