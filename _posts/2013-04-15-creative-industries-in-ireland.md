With much discussion on the smart economy, the recent talk given at Forfas (11 Nov 2010) on creative industries by Professor Dominic Power, Uppsala University is instructive. Power has been asked by the EC to survey creative industries in Europe and is regarded as an authority on the subject. We are not alone is seeking to foster creative industries. In fact it is a buzz word in many parts of Europe. He had some useful advice on supports for new creative industries, including affordable space, and ‘ice-breaker’ funds.

There is a preponderance of creative industries in Dublin compared to the rest of Ireland, but it is notable that this is due to a large extent to media related industries. Manufacturing and crafts are more widely scattered. For more info see study by Declan Curran & Chris van Egeraat of NIRSA for Dublin City Council ‘Defining and valuing Dublin’s creative Industries’.
