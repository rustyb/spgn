The Spatial Planning Graduate Network is a community of planners who have graduated from the Dublin Institute of Technology’s Masters of Science in Spatial Planning. This Masters programme provides an opportunity for highly skilled and experienced practitioners working in the Built Environment and planning sectors in Ireland or abroad, to become professional planners. All graduates and current students are automatic members of the Graduate Network.

The Network aims to provide opportunities for graduates of the course to network and keep up-to-date on relevant planning practice issues and developments on the spatial planning developments. The Spatial Planning Graduate Network aims to run a number of Continuous Professional Development sessions for its members each year and to undertake a Forum on Spatial Planning at least once a year. The Spatial Planning Graduate Network will have a web page – www.spatialplanning.ie – for members which will outline events and contain information on all our members so that they can communicate with each other, including short profiles. One open part of the Web Page will be an ongoing Blog in which members can contribute to and receive comments from other members. The Network intends, through the forum and its online platform at www.spatialplanning.ie, to facilitate critical discussion of the state of Spatial Planning in Ireland.

The Network is overseen by an organisation Committee, which is made up of volunteers from the membership of the Spatial Planning Graduate Network. The current membership of the Network Committee is 10 persons. The Chairperson and Officers have been elected from within the Committee by the Committee members. Details of each of the current Committee members are set out below. Brief and simple rules for the organization will be developed over the coming year and sent out for consideration and eventual approval.
